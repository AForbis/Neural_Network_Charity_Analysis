# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis

    - We needed to use the features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that was capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results

    - Data Preprocessing
        - The target variables were IS_SUCCESSFUL_N and IS_SUCCESSFUL_Y.
        - The variables considered to be the features of the model were all the remaining variables that were not IS_SUCCESSFUL_N, IS_SUCCESSFUL_Y, EIN, and NAME.
        - The EIN and NAME variables were neither targets nor features, and thus were removed from the input data.

    - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
        How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
# Summary

    - Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
